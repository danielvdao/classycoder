**_The Classy Coder_**
==============

My first android app (hopefully). It will send out texts at certain times, depending on whether or not you're subscribed. If you aren't subscribed, it should send you a text through your phone only once. 

**_todo_**

- Get the SMS class actually functioning
- Read the text from the assets file and get it to display 
- ~~Make the project~~ Done.
