**_The Classy Coder_**
==============

My first android app (hopefully). It will send out texts daily, depending on whether or not you're subscribed. If you aren't subscribed, it should send you a text to a phone number only once. Some of the classes I used in here are SmsManager (for texting) and AlarmReceiver/PendingIntent (for receiving later intents). The biggest problem I've found in this project is that Android has a very terrible UI software and is absolutely horrendous when it comes to developing front end code. 

**_todo_**

- ~~Get the SMS class actually functioning~~ Done. 
- ~~Read the text from the assets file and get it to display~~ Done.  
- ~~Make the project~~ Done.
- ~~Get the SMS to send daily~~ Done with AlarmReceiver. 
- ~~Get the SMS to send three times a day (not necessary, but would be nice)~~ Decided on twice a day, but done regardless. 
- Set up the database 
- Make a nice layout
